        <h2> Overview </h2>
        <p>In this assignment, students will build a choose-your-own adventure game that integrates generative AI to
          create
          a dynamic, interactive, “infinite story” experience for users. The experience is drive by nested dictionary
          (JSON)
          objects containing information for each pre-existing "scene" in the story. Each scene is also a nested
          dictionary
          containing choices a user could make for where to go next from this point in the story, a scene description,
          and
          more. In order to stitch together their infinite story creation, students are challenged to navigate and
          manipulate this deeply nested data dictionary, and along the way, they develop an appreciation for the utility
          and
          structure of dictionary objects. The core concept is that if a user ventures into a scene that hasn't been
          predefined, the program will request ChatGPT to generate the next scene, allowing the adventure to continue
          seamlessly.</p>

        <img src="img/start_of_program.png" alt="Start of the Infinite Story Program" class="main-image" />

        <p>The assignment is broken into milestones, beginning with loading the story data from a JSON file and
          identifying
          "dead ends" where scene references exist without corresponding definitions. Students will then create
          functions to
          print scenes and allow users to make choices that guide the narrative. As users explore, the game will
          transition
          from one scene to another until it encounters an undefined scene, at which point it calls ChatGPT to generate
          the
          next part of the story.</p>

        <p>The last part of the assignment invites students to reflect on AI ethics and engage in a deeper analysis of
          the
          potential strengths, weaknesses, and appropriate applications of integrating Generative AI into their
          projects.
        </p>

        <p>By completing this assignment, students will reinforce their understanding of dictionaries, nested data
          structures, and function decomposition. They will also gain practical experience working with APIs and
          consider
          the ethical implications of generative AI.</p>

        <p>We believe the “Nifty” aspect of our assignment comes from a few places:</p>
        <p>Students learn about and unleash the power of Generative AI to discover “infinity!” When their user reaches a
          scene that is not present in the story data dictionary, students get to make an API call to ChatGPT to obtain
          the
          missing data, and continue onwards. Our assignment is, to the best of our knowledge, one of the first to
          integrate
          the usage of LLMs and Generative AI in introductory CS education, opening up exciting possibilities for
          students.
        </p>

        <p>We also think it is nifty to show students that Generative AI can be a tool to make their programs more
          wonderful, rather than just something that can write code.</p>

        <p>As the user visits various scenes, students get to display DallE-generated visuals (provided to them) for the
          scene, leaving for a memorable experience. </p>

      <h2>Teaching Notes</h2>
      <p>
        In order to provide free access for students to the OpenAI API, we created a wrapper around the OpenAI API,
        which
        we call NotOpenAI. We also generated API keys for each student using a single shared account for the class.
        This
        allowed students to use the API without needing to create their own accounts or pay for access. The wrapper is
        available in the starter code for the assignment in the folder titled "notopenai". We then routed all requests
        through our wrapper function so that we could monitor usage and ensure that students were not abusing the API.
        This allowed us to provide students with a safe and free way to use the OpenAI API for their assignment. We
        also
        provided instructions for students to create their own OpenAI API key if they wanted to use the API outside of
        the
        assignment.
      </p>

      <h2>Feedback</h2>

      <p>Students seemed to enjoy this assignment and found the assignment help their understanding of dictionaries:
      </p>

      <blockquote class="blockquote-custom">
        <p>“I thought it was fun. It was a good way to learn about AI and practice using dictionaries and I actually
          enjoyed the extensions.”</p>
        <p>“I loved the assignment, it encapsulated the last unit of CS106A very well and was engaging.”</p>
      </blockquote>

      <p>While the main goal was to give students a chance to further understand dictionaries and nested structures,
        they
        also seemed to appreciate the assignment’s use of ChatGPT, especially at a time where it is so relevant:</p>

      <blockquote class="blockquote-custom">
        <p>“I LOVED IT!!! It was an awesome way to become more familiar w/ LLM in coding, and it was super fun to mess
          around with and add to.”</p>
        <p>“I thought it was really nice that the class decided to embrace ChatGPT and teach us how to use it. It was
          easier once I understood how to call it and retrieve answers. It wasn’t as difficult coding complexity wise
          but
          it was definitely fun to use and opened up the path for different things we could do on our own.”</p>
        <p>“Incredibly cool assignment, very empowering to be able to do this kind of project in an introductory
          class.”
        </p>
      </blockquote>

      <p>Course teaching assistants seemed to feel similarly; one mentioned that they felt as if “students generally
        liked
        it” and that it “made them feel they could build something actually useful in the real world.”</p>


      <h2>Improvements</h2>
      <p> Students and course staff seemed to agree that some of the beginning parts (JSON parsing) of the assignment
        were
        daunting. It was common for students to feel intimidated and worried to start the assignment without any
        support
        because of how complex the nesting was. Perhaps in future offerings of the assignment, extra diagrams/a
        walkthrough tutorial video for getting started could be made available to students to help them feel less
        overwhelmed with the beginning stages of the process. </p>
